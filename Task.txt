Task – 
Here at the NEC, we host an Annual Christmas party for our Exhibition Organisers – as you can imagine, this requires a massive amount of logistical planning. 
For this reason, we send out an invite to potential attendees beforehand, driving them to a landing page in order to capture all of the necessary information.
The theme last year was a New York Christmas. The PDF "Christmas Party 2017" is an example of the printed DM we sent. 
 
Your task is to style and structure the landing page by presenting the questions in a user-friendly, on-brand, attractive data capture form.
It is up to you how you get the work to us: host it somewhere, send by zip folder, upload to wetransfer, share by dropbox… whatever works for you.

We’re looking for you to prove your creative, coding and user interface skills.

Notes:
- The form doesn't need to be submitted anywhere. A thank you message when they click "finish" will be enough.
- Notice two different end points on the form: 
                - The user won't be attending the event. (Select NO on "Are you able to attend our Christmas party")
                - The user fills in all the required information to attend the event.
- There are some fields that may not be required depending on the user selections. For example, the dietary requirements if they don't have any.
